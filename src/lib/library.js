    desc: 'When Igzier refuses to play along with a poisoned natural causes verdict, the city gives him a choice: execution… or exile off the ledge. He survives the fall, Stryker—a ptero-raptor who jumps after him. Igzier collides with:• Ravel, a synesthetic forest healer who hears the world in colors and vibrations instead of words. Karys, a greenhouse heir in Sky City who sees the rot in its pipes and politics. Jairo, another mixed-lineage talent caught between loyalty and doubt. Silurian river clans, Mystic Woods healers and menaces, and ancient Cambrian symbols that suggest Tethys has been watching this experiment for much longer than the City thinks. Im D.C. Barletta —biologist, coder, nerd with a nail gun. I build systems in real life and I break them in fiction. If you like epic fantasy with real biology and evolution under the hood, sky cities, bonded creatures, and morally messy revolutions - character-driven dialogue, weird healers, and political fallout, then welcome to World of Tethys. This is Book I of The Ash Age Trilogy.',
